SSIR, Bangalore visited our campus for hiring Software Engineers and Hardware Engineers from final year batch. They were offering 6-Month internship + FTE offer. Their JD mentioned work in bluetooth, hardware and system software for hardware components, etc. This was a core electronics company but they had software roles as well in cloud, operating systems and system software. The package they were offering was 21 LPA.

Their hiring process had 4 rounds, each one was an elimination round. They were :-

* Online Coding Test
* 1st Technical Interview
* 2nd Technical Interview
* HR Interview

The interviews were mainly focused on DSA and core subjects like OS and OOP, questions from my resume were not asked. The interviews were held on Knox Meeting. The contents of the rounds were as follows :-

* Online Coding Test

  * This test contained of three coding questions of easy-medium level and the duration was 90-120 minutes. The questions were mostly from Leetcode or were a variation of the questions. This round would be easy for you if you do competitive coding or practice DSA regularly on Leetcode.
  * The platform they used was Aon. If you have the chance, try to use the platform and give a sample test, as the compiler glitches sometimes. The languages allowed were C++, Java, Python and JavaScript.
  * Everyone had different questions, so there is no point in sharing the questions from the test.
* 1st Technical Interview

  * This round was focused on core subjects like OOP and OS, and the interviewer focused on my knowledge of C/C++ and the memory structure that it uses.
  * She asked me questions on OOP by giving different scenarios of class and function declarations and how would the compiler handle it, and what errors might arise. She also asked me about the memory allocation that would take place in case of different types of object declarations.
  * Then she moved on to the technologies and programming languages I've worked with, to which I answered GoLang, Java, Python and JavaScript to which the interview didn't seem to ask any questions on, which showed that they want mainly C/C++ developers and that is also probably what they work on.
  * After this she moved on to DSA, she asked the approach to solve [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/). I gave the sub-optimal as well as optimal approach and she seemed happy with the answer. Then she asked questions about my favourite Data Structure (here i would suggest not to say DS like Graphs, Trees unless you are very confident about them), to which I answered Linked List xD. I was asked the time complexity to insert, modify and search the LL. Although these questions are easy to answer but the way in which you answer makes a difference, I explained on every step how I reached the conclusion about the time complexity, memory required etc.
  * This round was positive and I managed to proceed to the next round.
* 2nd Technical Interview

  * This was a particularly difficult interview for me, as the interview was focused on OS and memory management in C/C++. I would suggest reading GFG about the same. Here are some articles which you should go through before the interview :-

    1. [Memory Layout of C program](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/)
    2. [Program Flow of a C Program](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-does-a-c-program-executes/)
  * The interviewer focused on theoretical knowledge and not problem solving or applications as much as the first round. He asked questions like how would you debug a program, how would you write unit tests and test every part of the program, some good coding practices etc.
  * This round was not as good as the first round for me, but yet I was moved forward to the HR interview.
* HR Interview

  * This was a phone Interview, and the HR from SSIR called me and we just had a discussion on the projects Iâ€˜ve worked on, my motivation to join SSIR and my family background and how i got into coding, etc, and I asked a few questions about the job location and thats it.

    After this the college was sent a list of selected students and I was selected for the software engineer role.
